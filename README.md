 Hezlich Willkommen!!
 
 **Writing code is not a big thing everyone could do that !!  But writing efficient and modular code is what counts.**
 
  * This repository is designed for people who are beginners or moderators in the field of Deep Learning.
 
  * This repository will give you an idea about how to write and work on every component that fuels a deep learning model.
 
  * I will be using the DogvsCat famous repository to do binary classification using Vanilla CNN to achieve around 95% of accuracy.
